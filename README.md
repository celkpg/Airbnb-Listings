Airbnb Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the price of Airbnb listings. It leverages data science techniques to analyze various features of listings and provide users with an estimate of the expected price.

Features
Data Exploration: In-depth analysis of the Airbnb dataset to understand the distribution of prices and the relationships between different features.

Feature Engineering: Identification and creation of relevant features to enhance the predictive power of the models.

Model Training: Implementation of machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forests, laaso and ridge regression, to predict listing prices.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessment of model performance using metrics like Adjusted R-Squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python installed on your machine.
Jupyter Notebook for running and modifying the data analysis and modeling notebooks.

Download the Airbnb dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data and train the models.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.

Follow the step-by-step instructions to explore the dataset and train the machine learning models.

Evaluate the model performance and tweak hyperparameters as needed.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the models, additional features, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
