Airbnb Market Analysis Project
Acquired real-time data from the Airbnb 'open data portal' and performed comprehensive data cleaning to enhance data quality and reliability.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) from the host's perspective, uncovering insights into host behavior, preferences, and trends.
Utilized advanced data cleaning techniques to address missing values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset and facilitating accurate analysis.
Engineered new features tailored to the host's viewpoint, enriching the dataset and providing additional context for analysis and decision-making.
Utilized Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards specifically designed to aid hosts in understanding their performance and optimizing their listings.
Developed machine learning models customized for host needs, providing predictive insights to enhance listing strategies and revenue potential.
Split dataset into training and validation sets for robust model evaluation.
Employed one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables for regression model compatibility.
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
Conducted Linear, LASSO, and Ridge Regression analysis for price prediction and feature selection.
Created histograms comparing actual versus predicted prices, offering visual insights into model performance on the validation datase
